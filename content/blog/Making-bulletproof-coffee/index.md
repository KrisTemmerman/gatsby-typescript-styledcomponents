# Easy Cold brew coffee

At the moment of writing a massive heatwave is passing over Europe, with temperatures reaching an unseen 40Â°C.

I love coffee and drink about 4 to 5 cups of brown gold a day. With these temperatures I like my coffee cold, but with no Starbucks or coffee bar around I brew my own.

Cold brew has a different flavour profile then your hot brew it's less acidic has a milder aroma and is the perfect started for all your ice coffee recipes.

## Ingredient list

- French press
- Coffee beans or ground coffee

## Ratio

- For every litre of water you need 115g of ground coffee.

# Recipe:

- ### Step 1: Put your coffee in the french press
  if you are grinding your own beans, keep them a bit coarser than usual as finely ground beans will over extract which leads to bitterness.

- ### Step 2: Add a litre of room temp water
  Stir the mixture so all coffee is submerged and ready to release its flavor.
  Don't press the plunger !

- ### Step 3: Put it in the fridge 
  Depending on how potent you want your coffee, leave it in the fridge for at least 8 hours.
  I take mine out after 12 hours.

- ### Step 4: Take french press out of the fridge
  You've been patient, congratulations, now stir and **PLUNGE**!
  

- ### Step 5: Pour the coffee in a container and clean your french press
  To stop the steeping process pour the filtered coffee in a different container.
  
  **You can keep it in the fridge for about 2 weeks**

Now we made cold brew coffee concentrate, which contains about **TWICE** as much caffeine than hot drip coffee.
To make a coffee, use a ratio of 50% concentrate and 50% fluids.
